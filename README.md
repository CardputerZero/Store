# CardputerZero AppStore

Device-side APPLaunch application for browsing CardputerZero registries and installing apps from online registry metadata.

AppStore installs only Debian `.deb` packages whose registry review status is
`approved`. The backend downloads the `.deb` to the local cache first, verifies
the registry `download.md5`, then installs the local file with the Raspberry Pi
OS/Debian package tools. Installed apps can be launched through their APPLaunch
`.desktop` file and removed with the package manager.

## Runtime

The LVGL UI calls the native backend compiled into the AppStore executable for
registry, install, upgrade, and uninstall operations. No Python runtime or
backend service is required.

Useful backend environment variables:

```bash
M5APPSTORE_STATE_DIR=/root/.local/share/cardputerzero-appstore
M5APPSTORE_APP_ROOT=/usr/share/APPLaunch
```

Default registry:

```text
https://cardputerzero.github.io/generated/registry.json
```

CN region registry:

```text
https://cardputer-zero-repo.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/packages/cn/registry.json
```

AppStore performs a fresh registry sync when it starts. Registry HTTP requests
send `Cache-Control: no-cache` and a timestamp query parameter so GitHub Pages
or intermediate CDN cache does not hide newly published entries. If a registry
cannot be loaded, the UI shows the load failure; if a previous catalog exists,
AppStore keeps showing the cached app list and marks the registry as cached.

Registry metadata and artwork use libhv asynchronous networking. Artwork is
downloaded in bounded batches of six requests so synchronization remains
responsive without exhausting device sockets. When an HTTP proxy is configured,
AppStore uses libhv's asynchronous thread pool with curl because libhv's native
async client does not implement HTTPS CONNECT proxy tunneling. Debian package
downloads continue to use curl so interrupted downloads can be resumed safely.

## Backend Commands

```bash
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --summary
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --registries
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --regions
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --set-region CN
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --add-registry https://example.com/generated/registry.json
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --sync
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --plan <app-id>
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --install <app-id>
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --upgrade <app-id>
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --uninstall <app-id>
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --prepare-package install <app-id>
./M5CardputerZero-AppStore --finalize-package install <app-id> <transaction-id>
```

`<app-id>` accepts either the app UUID or its `share_code` from registry metadata.

The LVGL application uses a three-stage package transaction. The unprivileged
`--prepare-package` stage downloads and verifies the package and records a
pending transaction. The UI then runs the emitted package helper command with
privileges. Finally, `--finalize-package` checks the real package state through
`dpkg-query` before updating AppStore's installed-app records. The original
`--install`, `--reinstall`, `--upgrade`, and `--uninstall` commands remain
available and use the same verification and record-update behavior.

Pending transactions are stored in the AppStore state directory using atomic
file replacement. AppStore reconciles them against the dpkg database on backend
startup and during summary refresh, so an interrupted finalize stage can be
completed after a restart. An interrupted transaction that provably left the
installed package state unchanged is cleared so it cannot block later
operations. A transaction remains pending when its outcome cannot be determined;
its diagnostic is reported again on the next reconciliation.

Package commands produce tab-separated, machine-readable status records.
`PACKAGE_JOB` describes the privileged step, `PACKAGE_RESULT` is the verified
terminal result, `WARNING` reports a non-fatal issue such as desktop-entry
repair, and `ERROR` reports a failed operation. Consumers must determine success
from the process exit code and `PACKAGE_RESULT`, not by searching free-form
package-manager output for words such as `ERROR`.

Desktop-entry repair is best effort. Failure to find or rewrite an APPLaunch
desktop entry is reported as `WARNING` after a successful package operation and
does not change the verified package result.

Multiple registries are supported. On the Registries settings screen, use the
region radio buttons to choose the built-in Default or CN registry. Add another
registry from the same screen or with `--add-registry`; the selected region
registry and all enabled custom registries are synced and merged into one app
list. Apps with the same UUID/share code are de-duplicated, with later registry
metadata taking precedence. On the home screen, use `Z/C` (left/right) to change
category and `F/X` (up/down) to select an app. Installed filters catalog apps by
their actual package installation state and refreshes after package operations.
The Installed category is hidden when empty; removing its last app returns the
selection to All. Long app names pause for two seconds, then scroll horizontally
at 20 pixels per second, with another pause at the end. Status-bar updates keep
the current reading position, and labels never scroll vertically.
The header shows the selection within the category and the total catalog size.
Press `4` for settings, `5` for share code, `6` for search, `7` for
install/reinstall, and `8` or Enter for details. AppStore syncs the registry
automatically when it starts.

The detail page shows the complete combined summary and description, followed
by 160 x 85 screenshot previews loaded from the registry. `F/X` scrolls the
whole content area; the system bar and bottom actions stay fixed. Descriptions
wrap without a height limit or automatic scrolling. `Z/C` cycles screenshots;
apps without screenshots have no screenshot area. Detail actions are `4` back,
`6` install/reinstall, `7` upgrade, and `8` remove, shown when applicable.
The existing full-screen screenshot viewer remains accessible through `5`.

Registry entries must provide a Debian package download:

```yaml
download:
  type: deb
  package: lofibox
  url: https://github.com/CardputerZero/packages/raw/main/pool/main/lofibox/lofibox_0.2.0-1~lofibox23_arm64.deb
  md5: 6a9798c1208e6d8bf5a9f28914160483
```

## Share Code Flow

On the AppStore home screen, press `5` to open the share code input page. Type
the code from CardputerZero Hub, then press `Enter` to jump to that app's detail
page. From there, use the normal install/reinstall flow.

## Fonts

The UI uses DejaVu Sans as its primary western font. Its glyph fallback is
Noto Sans CJK, which covers Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text while DejaVu
continues to render Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and other western scripts. The
corresponding serif pair is also initialized for consumers that request it:
DejaVu Serif with Noto Serif CJK.

The default device paths are:

```text
/usr/share/APPLaunch/share/font/DejaVuSans.ttf
/usr/share/APPLaunch/share/font/DejaVuSerif.ttf
/usr/share/APPLaunch/share/font/NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc
/usr/share/APPLaunch/share/font/NotoSerifCJK-Regular.ttc
```

Override paths when running on a system with a different font layout using
`M5APPSTORE_LATIN_SANS_FONT`, `M5APPSTORE_LATIN_SERIF_FONT`,
`M5APPSTORE_CJK_SANS_FONT`, and `M5APPSTORE_CJK_SERIF_FONT`.
